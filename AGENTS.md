# Objective

Our objective is to create a web app which users point at a landmark at a pre-specified direction and distance, and shows them a pre-rendered video of what that landmark used to look like back in history. This is intended to be used from a phone, where the accelerometer will be used to provide limited pan capabilities by moving the phone.

# Agent rules

You MUST:

- Always research SvelteKit syntax before suggesting solutions
- Use the svelte mcp server you are connected to
- Use modern TypeScript syntax
- Do not code unless explicitly told to, often I just want advice
- Do NOT produce tests
